## Project Experience

Below are two key projects that I have completed to demonstrate my practical skills in cybersecurity:

### **Project 1: Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment**
**Objective:** Conducted a vulnerability assessment on local and external-facing assets to identify and mitigate security risks, leveraging both passive and active reconnaissance techniques.  
**Tools Used:** Shodan, Nmap, Dirsearch, Sublist3r, Xray, Metasploit  

**Methodology:**  
  1. **Passive Information Gathering with Shodan:**  
     - Used Shodan to perform passive reconnaissance, identifying publicly exposed services, devices, and their associated metadata.  
     - Collected information on open ports, service banners, and potential vulnerabilities for external-facing assets.  

  2. **Active Information Gathering with Nmap:**  
     - Conducted network scans using Nmap to enumerate open ports, running services, and operating system information.  
     - Used Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to detect vulnerabilities such as outdated software versions, default credentials, and misconfigurations.  

  3. **Subdomain Enumeration:**  
     - Used sublist3r enumeration tools to discover additional subdomains, expanding the attack surface for potential vulnerabilities.  

  4. **Directory Scanning with Dirsearch:**  
     - Performed directory brute-forcing on web servers using Dirsearch to locate hidden or sensitive directories, including admin panels and backup files.  

  5. **Vulnerability Scanning with Xray:**  
     - Utilized Xray scanner to identify critical vulnerabilities in web applications, including SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and file inclusion vulnerabilities.  

  6. **Exploitation and Post-Exploitation with Metasploit:**  
     - Leveraged Metasploit Framework to simulate exploitation of identified vulnerabilities in a controlled environment, including privilege escalation and lateral movement.  
     - Performed post-exploitation tasks, such as gathering sensitive information, system enumeration, and setting up persistence, to assess the impact of the vulnerabilities.  

**Outcome:**  
  - Successfully uncovered 8 critical vulnerabilities, including exposed sensitive directories, SQL inject,XSS, File Upload Vulnerability in web applications.  
  - Provided a detailed report with prioritized mitigation strategies, recommending actions such as patch management, access control updates, and enhanced monitoring.  
  - Strengthened the security posture of the organization by resolving all critical issues and improving overall resilience against potential attacks.

### **Project 2: Malware Analysis**
**Objective:** Analyzed the behavior of a ransomware sample in a controlled environment to understand its infection mechanism.  
**Tools Used:** IDA Pro, Ghidra, VirtualBox, Wireshark  
**Methodology:**  
  - Ran the malware in an isolated virtual machine to observe its behavior.  
  - Used IDA Pro and Ghidra to reverse-engineer the binary and analyze its code.  
  - Captured network traffic with Wireshark to identify command-and-control (C2) communication patterns.  
  - Documented the malware's encryption process and identified mitigation strategies.  
**Outcome:** Produced a detailed report outlining the malware’s lifecycle, infection vectors, and steps to prevent similar attacks.

## Learning Journey

### What I've Learned So Far:
Gained a solid foundation in penetration testing, including OWASP Top10 vulnerability.  
Learned to use tools like Wireshark,Nmap,Metasploit for network traffic analysis and threat detection.  
Developed skills in malware reverse engineering, including static and dynamic analysis using tools like Ghidra, IDA.  

### Challenges:
- **Malware Analysis:** Understanding obfuscation techniques used by advanced malware.  
- **Incident Response:** Developing speed and accuracy in identifying and responding to threats.  

### Improvement Plan:
Continue practicing malware analysis by working with real-world samples in a safe lab environment.  
Enroll in advanced courses on incident response and forensic analysis.  
Participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges to hone practical skills.

## Career Objective

My ultimate goal is to become a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and work in a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Threat Analyst or Penetration Tester. I aim to specialize in proactive threat hunting, vulnerability management, and helping organizations secure their digital infrastructure.
